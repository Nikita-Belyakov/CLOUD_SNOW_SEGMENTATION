## **About:**

This project is devoted to the cloud and snow semantic segmentation using multispectral satellite images, received from a multizone scanning instrument (MSU-GS) used for hydrometeorological support and installed on the Russian satellite Electro-L No. 2. As the additional information, geographical information (latitude, longitude and altitude) is used. The main difficulty of snow and cloud discrimination using Electro-L No. 2 data is the absence of spectral channels in the range 1300-1600 nm, which are necessary for accurate separation snow from cloud textures (NDSI tests). The results of this work include a self-collected dataset with Electro-L No. 2 imagery, cloud masks for it from the geostationary satellites GOES-16, Meteosat-10 and snow masks from Terra/MODIS. We also at a trained Multi-Scale Attention Network (MANet) segmentation model weights (from SMP: https://smp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models.html), able to do accurate segmentation of cloud ansd snow for MSU-GS multispectral data. The proposed  neural network for clouds and snow segmentation has been tested for different seasons and daytime periods with different level of illumination of images. The developed algorithm works in any season of the year during the daytime and is able to perform cloud and snow segmentation in real time mode for Electro-L No.2 and GOES-R data.

- Weights of model for Electro-L No.2 data can be loaded from **models** and used for data_inference in **INFERENCE.ipynb** as an example
- GOES-16 L2 products used for cloud masks were obtained from Amazon:

- Meteosat-10 L2 products used for cloud masks were obtained from Eumetsat Store:

## Setup python version
The **INFERENCE.ipynb** and other notebooks files have been run with `python 3.9.7` on Windows 10 OS with NVIDIA CUDA supported (Adapt all needed packages versions accroding your Python version)

### All required packages are written in requirements.txt
- It's recomended to use `Pytorch` version with CUDA support! To install pytorch with cuda run appropriate command in your console from here:
  - https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
  - (We used this version of cudann: `pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116`)
- There are seperated **requrements.txt** for each **.ipynb** in every folder in this repo! Be careful!
- Just run in your .ipynb this cell:
```
 !pip install -r requirements.txt
```
